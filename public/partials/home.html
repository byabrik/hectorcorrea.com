  <h1>Welcome to HectorCorrea.com</h1>

  <p>I am a software developer in State College, PA. This site is where I host <a ng-href="/#/blog">my blog</a> and post small articles about software development as well as code samples.</p>
   
  <p>My main areas of interest are web development in small and collaborative teams. I also enjoy learning new and interesting technologies and you'll find a wide variety of topics in my blog including algorithms and data structures, Ruby on Rails, Node.js/JavaScript, C#/ASP.NET MVC, NoSQL databases, event-driven architectures, and bit of functional programming.</p>

  <p>Feel free to browse around and contact me at <a href="mailto:hector@hectorcorrea.com">hector@hectorcorrea.com</a> if you have any questions or comments.</p>
